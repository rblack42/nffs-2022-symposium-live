    "# Erbach's Power Calculator\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 1990 edition of the NFFS Symposium, Walter Erbach published a program {cite}`erbach90` that calculates the power required for an indoor model to maintain level flight. Since Walt was a highly respected model builder and a Professor of Engineering Mechanics at the University of Nebraska, I decided to try his code out for this study.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, his program was written in *Basic* for the Commodore 64, which tells you something about how old this is!. My first job was to recast this code in Python and see if I could recreate the data he showed in his article.\n",
    "\n",
    "In working through this conversion, I found several errors that needed to be fixed in order to get usable output. Walt originally wrote this progrm in *FORTRAN* and I suspect converting it to a very limited first generation home computer was difficult, and his listing may not be totally correct. The data shown in his report was probably produced from his original code."
