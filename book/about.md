# About This Document

This document is different from most web pages you run into on the Internet.
Depending on how you reached thispage, you might belooking at a static web page
where all you can do is click on links and scroll around. One the otherhand,
youmight have reached thispage by downloading the source for it to yourlocal
machine. Withthe right tools in place, you can "run this page, using the *Jupyter*
engine to acturlly process all the embedded code and see the final results. Even
better, youmight have found this page by navigating to a link at
**mybinder.org**. In this cae, clicking on that link started up aprocess ona
*clous Server that creates a new *virtual machine for you, installs *Python*
and anything else needed for this project, then launches a web server that
presents the page to you. In this setup, the document is just as "live" as it
was onmymachine,except you didnot havetodoany setup work. Youcan run the codein
thepageeven if you arelookig at thispage using a tablet!

## Creating the Symposium Article

Unfortunately, the content in a *Jupyter* format is not suitable for publishing
in something like the *NFFS Symposium*, so I created the print version of the
document in a different way.

As a researcher, and an educator,I have along history of producing high-quality
documents containing a lot of math and technical figures using the $\LaTeX$ tool chain.
On my Macbook, I have installed *MacTex* which creates a set of tools that convert
a document written a special way into something a publisher will love.
The marked up source document takes some getting used to, but I have used it to
produce lecture notes, Master's thesis books, and even professional resumes for
a job search. Best of all $\LaTeX$ is free and runs on any platform.

## Reproducible Science

You can regenerate this document any time you wish, and verify for yourself
that what I have presented in print is exactly what I presented. I wrote the
basic material directly on my machine using a web browser and *Jupyter*. I have
set up a process that uses *GitHub* to save a public copy of this project code
on a server anyone can access. Even better, anyone can doenload all of the code
I use onmy local machine and use it on their own machine. This is all a part of
a new form of research called *reproducible Science" where te research results
can beindependently verified by anyone!


## Project Development Workflow

I work on a Macbook
When I finish work on the project, I "push" the new versionof theproject to *GitHub* and it is automatically run through a set of tests to confirm that everything works properly. You can see "badges"on the homepagefpr thisprohject on *GitHub*.

The static version of thisproject is available on the *GitHub* server at [thislink](https;//rblack.github.io/nffs-2022-symposium-live). It is also available by clicking on the **Launch Binder* button on the home page. That link takes you to **mybinder.org** where alive version ogf the document will appear (after a bit of time while they complete the setup of a new *virtual machine*.

When someone
was produced using the *Python* *Jupiter Book* tool, which is very popular in
the data science world. Basically, once you have set up the required Python
environment, you can step through this document using a web browser on your
local machine and execute all code presented. This scheme is part of a move to
present \"reproducible science\" by researchers world wide. The idea is simple.
All the work needed to generate some scientific result is documented in a way
that anyone can check to verify that things work as reported. For this project,
both the mathematical equations used in this project, and the resulting Python
code are described in one document that is checked every time I generate the
project website you are probably reading now.

Have fun with this. Happy flying!
