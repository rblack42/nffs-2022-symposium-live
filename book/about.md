# About This Document

This document is very different from most web pages you run into on the Internet.
Depending on how you reached this page, you might be looking at a static web page
where all you can do is click on links and scroll around. On the other hand,
you might have reached this page by downloading the source for it to yourlocal
machine. With the right tools in place, you can *run* this page, using the *Python* *Jupyter*
system to actually process all the embedded code and see the final results. Even
better, youvnmight have found this page by navigating to a link at
**mybinder.org**. In this case, clicking on that link started up  aprocess on a
*Cloud Server* that creates a new *virtual machine* for you, installs *Python*
and anything else needed for this project, then launches a web server that
presents the page to you. In this setup, the document is just as "live" as it
was on my machine,except you did not have to do any setup work. You can run the code in
the page even if you are lookig at this page using a tablet!

## Creating the Symposium Article

Unfortunately, the content in a *Jupyter* format is not suitable for publishing
in something like the *NFFS Symposium*, so I created the print version of the
document in a different way.

As a researcher, and an educator,I have along history of producing high-quality
documents containing a lot of math and technical figures using the $\LaTeX$ tool chain.
On my Macbook, I have installed *MacTex* which creates a set of tools that convert
a document written a special way into something a publisher will love.
The marked up source document takes some getting used to, but I have used it to
produce lecture notes, Master's thesis books, and even professional resumes for
a job search. Best of all $\LaTeX$ is free and runs on any platform.

## Reproducible Science

You can regenerate this document any time you wish, and verify for yourself
that what I have presented in print is exactly what you see for yourself. I wrote the
basic material directly on my machine using a web browser and *Jupyter*. I have
set up a process that uses *GitHub* to save a public copy of this project code
on a server anyone can access. Even better, anyone can download all of the code
I use on  my local machine and use it on their own machine. This is all a part of
a new form of research called *Reproducible Science" where the research results
can be independently verified by anyone!


## Project Development Workflow

I work on a Macbook. When I finish work on the project, I "push" the new
version of the project files to *GitHub* and all the code is automatically run
through a set of tests to confirm that everything works properly. You can see
*badges* on the homepage for this project on *GitHub* showing the current
status.

The static version of this project is available on the *GitHub* server at [this
link](https;//rblack.github.io/nffs-2022-symposium-live). It is also available
by clicking on the **Launch Binder* button on the home page. That link takes
you to **mybinder.org** where alive version of the document will appear (after
a bit of time while they complete the setup of a new *virtual machine*).

The documentation for this project was produced using the *Python* *Jupiter
Book* tool, which is very popular in the data science world. Basically, once
you have set up the required Python environment, you can open up a web browser
on your local machine and work on project files. *Jupyter* lets you add both
code and text and process each block to get results. Text will look better, and
code will actually be run to produce results. Those results will be displayed
immediately below the code block. This is an amazing way to experiment with
code and document it at the same time.  When you are ready, *Jupyter Book*
assembles a collection of *Jupyter Notebooks* into a book-like set of web pages
with links added to navigate around in the document.

I took the final *Jupyter Book* pages and generated the article that I
submitted ththe NFFS editor for the Symposium publication. I am working on
automating that last step now.

## Support NFFS

Producing a document using this approach let me present my research in a useful
format, and have made it easily available to anyone interested in indoor
flying. However,please join the NFFS and get a copy of their annual Symposium.
There are always interesting articles by all sorts of model builders who try to
apply their technical expertise to advancing our hobby.
Your NFFS membership goes a long way to help promote our
hobby, and support those of us fascinated by flight.


Have fun with all of this exciting new technology. Hopefully, I have contributed
something useful to the many model builders who enjoy his hobby.

Happy flying!
