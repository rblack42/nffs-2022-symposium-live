    "You should be familiar with the basics of managing where things are stored on your system. We are taught to think of our hard disk as a collection of folders inside of which we might find *files* or other folders*. This is supposed to look like a filing cabinet. In some circles, *folders* are also called *directories*, but the idea is the same.\n",

    "We refer to a specific item in this system using a *path* to that item. For example, on a Windows machine, a file in your *Home Directory* is located in ** C:\\Users\\username **\n",
    "On a Mac, this would look like this: **/Users/username**. Both of these examples tell the system to look in the *Users* folder at the top of our drive, then look dor a *username* folder inside thatone. The character between those is called a *separator* and windows uses a different character from the rest of the computer world. In Python, we will always use a forwrd slsh, even if we are using a windows machine!\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of these xample are referring to a folder. If the last item in the line names a file, you cannot try to add another component to the path. You need to fire up some program that knows what to do with a file to process that.\n",
