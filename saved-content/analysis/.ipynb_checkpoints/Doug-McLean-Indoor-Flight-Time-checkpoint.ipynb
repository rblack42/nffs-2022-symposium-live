    "# A Method For Predicting Indoor Model Duration (2021 Edition)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 1976 edition of the NFFS Symposium, Doug McLean presented a paper on predicting flight times for indoor model airplanes. As part of my work on the [Math Magik](https://rblack42.github.io/math-magik)  project I started for my 2021 symposium article, I decided to revisit Doug's effort, and work through the math used in his paper using some help from Python *SymPy*.\n",
    "\n",
    "This article will not intended to be a rewrite of Doug's work. Instead, I will focus on validating the the math he presented and attempt to create a solid Python program to do the calculations. Towards that end, this article is being written using the *Jupyter Notebook* system, very popular in the data science world where researchers want to build \"recreatable research\" documentation. Anyone should be able to produce exactly the same results shown in the documentation by following the steps presented there.\n",

That is on purpose, since I want readers with little background in advanced math and aerospace engineering to be able to follow what is going on. (Sorry, all my years teaching forces me to do this! If you are more familiar with some of these concepts, just skip over the low level stuff!)"

In the absense of better data I decided to build a simple Python function that will give an estimate of motor torque (shown by the symbol **Q**) as a function of motor turns. This function obviously needs better data to account for motor dimensions and weight, but it will do for the present time.\n",

    "Those values look good enough. Obviously, this function needs better data to produce values for varying rubber sizes. Also, since most modelers use motors longer than the distance between hooks, the actual torque available during a flight will vary as winds run out and the motor begins to sag. Hopefully testing can provide some insights into this behavior."

There will be losses in this process. Not all of the energy input to the propeller will be converted into forward thrust.\n",

    "\n",
    "In most classes, the propeller blade is thinned in the front part of the blade to allow for some amount of flair, where the propeller pitch increases under high torque right after launch. This is supposed to help in getting the airplane t climb faster during that power burst. \n",

    "The propeller is driven by the rubber motor which is attached to a wire shaft at the center of the prop. We know there is a torgue presented to the prop by that motor, but we need to figureout how the prop convertts that energy into a forward thrust that moves the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The axis of that driving shaft may not align with the model. In many cases, side and downward thrustlines are used to control the early part of a flight. We will need to account for this n our clculations.\n",
