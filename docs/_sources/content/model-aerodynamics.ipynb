    "Long before computers first appeared, aeronautical research involved watching vehicles fly and thinking about what was going on in the air around that vehicle. They then tried to come up with mathematical approximations that seemed to agree with their observations. This thinking led to two theories that we will use here: *Thin Airfoil Theory* developed by Munk and Glauert in the 1920's {cite}`glauert` and *Lifting Line Theory* developed by Lanchester and Prandtl {cite}`prandtl`shortly after the Wright Brothers first flew. Their work tried to account for the  vortexes observed at the tips of flying surfaces."
