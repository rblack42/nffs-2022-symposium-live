Geometry
========

**TO BE UPDATED...**

For the meshing of the wing, it is important to keep track of what parts of the wing is "static" and what parts are "movable" (control surfaces). This book keeping is done using ``Subdivisions`` and ``Subareas``. The smallest unit (subareas) are small quadrilateral segments of the wing. They "know" where they are located, and to what segment and to what control device they belong.

.. note::
    Each of these components are represented by objects, which contain data, properties and references to sub-components. Each component is identified and accessed by a unique string, or name. Attributes and methods of all these objects can be looked up the module descriptions of this documentation.

Segment geometry
----------------

vertices.a, vertices.b, vertices.c and vertices.d are the four corner points of each segment. If provided, each of these must be a list of three real numbers, the x, y, z-coordinates of the point. If not, they should be set to NONE, or they may simply be omitted.

   Ordering

geometry.inner_chord is the chord of the segment edge AD. geometry.inner_chord must be a real number. If geometry.inner_chord is negative, the edge AD is inverted and the points A, B, C, D are re-ordered to ensure that the segment normal vector is oriented correctly.

geometry.inner_alpha is the angle of incidence of the segment edge AD. geometry.inner_alpha must be a real number between -90.0 and +90.0 (degrees).

geometry.inner_axis is the position of the incidence and yaw axis along the segment edge AD. geometry.inner_axis must be a real number between 0.0 and 1.0 (chord fraction). By default, the axis lies along the quarter-chord line, at 0.25.

geometry.outer_chord is the chord of the segment edge BC. geometry.outer_chord must be a real number. If geometry.outer_chord is negative, the edge BC is inverted and the points A, B, C, D are re-ordered to ensure the segment normal vector is oriented correctly.

geometry.outer_alpha is the angle of incidence of the segment edge BC. geometry.outer_alpha must be a real number between -90.0 and +90.0 (degrees).

geometry.outer_beta is the angle of yaw of the segment edge BC. geometry.outer_beta must be a real number between -90.0 and +90.0 (degrees).

geometry.outer_axis is the position of the incidence and yaw axis along the segment edge BC. geometry.outer_axis must be a real number between 0.0 and 1.0 (chord fraction). By default, the axis lies along the quarter-chord line, at 0.25.

geometry.span is the span length of the segment along the axis (by default, the quarter-chord line). geometry.span must be a real number. If geometry.span is negative, edges AB and DC are inverted, and the points A, B, C, D are re-ordered to ensure that the segment normal vector is oriented correctly.

geometry.sweep is the angle sweep measured at the leading edge AD. geometry.sweep must be a real number, strictly between -90.0 and +90.0 (degrees).

geometry.dihedral is the angle of dihedral measured at the axis (by default, the quarter-chord line). geometry.dihedral must be a real number between -90.0 and +90.0 (degrees).

At least one of vertices.a, vertices.b, vertices.c or vertices.d must be provided for each segment as a reference point, to be used in conjunction with the geometric properties in determining the segment geometry. The user must provide either:

    * all of geometry.*, with one of vertices.a, vertices.b, vertices.c or vertices.d. (one reference point and all geometric parameters)
    * all of geometry.* except geometry.inner_*, with vertices.a and vertices.d. (edge AD and the remaining geometric parameters)
    * all of geometry.* except geometry.outer_*, with vertices.b and vertices.c. (edge BC and the remaining geometric parameters)
    * none of geometry.* and all of vertices.a, vertices.b, vertices.c and vertices.d. (all points ABCD)

Airfoils
~~~~~~~~

airfoils.inner is the name of the wing profile at the segment edge AD. airfoils.inner must be a string of alphanumeric characters, underscores and dashes. The corresponding file blade.* must exist within the airfoils folder of the project directory.

panels.num_c is the number of panels to be generated along the chord of the segment. If provided, panels.num_c must be a positive integer. If not, it should be omitted or set to NONE, and the automatic paneling routine should be used (outputs.autopanels in the settings file).
