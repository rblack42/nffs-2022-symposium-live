Input files
===========

.. note::

    This section discusses the input files when using |name|'s native format (JSON). Note that the inputs may differ if you want to use CPACS_. For the use of CPACS_ please refer to :ref:`input_file_cpacs`.

|name| input files are all based on the standardised JSON format. Essentially, JSON files are made up of *keywords* and *data fields*. Using this keyword-data structure arbitrarily complex object definitions can be generated. Notice that there is a very strict syntax. For instance, keywords must be delimited by quotation marks and brackets must always be closed. If the JSON syntax of any input file is invalid, |name| will not be able to import the file. Notice also that all keywords and data entries are *case-sensitive* (e.g. ``true`` and ``false`` must be lower-case according to the JSON syntax).
