    Airfoils

    * Airfoils which are read from a file must obey a certain format
        * See UIUC format
        * Geometric twist may not be defined in the input data as this will lead to an incorrect modelling of the camber liner

    What |name| does not do...

    * Controls surfaces can be rotated around a hine axis. However, the control surface cannot be "translated" (moved up/down/back/forward), e.g. like for some 'flaps'
